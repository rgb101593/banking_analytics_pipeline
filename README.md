# banking_analytics_pipeline
A demonstration project showcasing data engineering and analytical skills for financial data roles. This repository implements a data pipeline using Dockerized PostgreSQL for storage, focusing on advanced SQL for extraction and transformation of simulated banking transaction data (customers, accounts, transactions). Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) is used for complex data processing, feature engineering (e.g., deriving behavioral metrics), and validation. The project emphasizes clean, efficient code, reproducibility (via Docker/Python venv), and high data integrity, aligning with requirements for roles involving large-scale data handling in the banking/finance sector. Jupyter Notebooks document the workflow, and Git manages version control.  Key Technologies: Python, Pandas, SQL (PostgreSQL), Docker, Jupyter Notebook, Data Pipeline, ETL, Data Validation, Feature Engineering.
